# HTML Project - Event Page, Tables, and Forms

This repository contains the starter and final code for two complete projects Event Page and a project focused on Tables and Forms.

## Project 1: Event Page

In this project, we will build an Event Page that will cover a wide range of fundamental HTML components. Throughout this project, the following HTML elements are used:

- Heading Tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- Paragraph Tags: `<p>`
- Anchor Tags: `<a>`
- Body Tag: `<body>`
- HTML Boilerplate: `<html>`
- Image Tag: `<img>`

## Project 2: Tables and Forms

In the second project, we will dive deeper into HTML by focusing on two important components: Tables and Forms. Tables are used to present data in a structured format, while forms are essential for user input and data submission.

- Table Tag: `<table>`
- Table Row Tag: `<tr>`
- Table Header Cell Tag: `<th>`
- Table Data Cell Tag: `<td>`
- Form Tag: `<form>`
- Input Tags: `<input>` (various types), `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, `<label>`, `<button>`

## How to Use this Repository
